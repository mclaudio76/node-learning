# node-learning
Some simple experiments with node.js and Typescript language.

# nodeREST
Playing with REST, MySQL and Typescript.
A simple project with a class, RESTServer, acting as helper to expose some REST services (via GET). To make things a bit more complex, the project provides a simple SQLQuery class as query helper, using a "fluent" API; this class is used to access an instance of MySQL server for performing a query, whose results are returned to the caller in JSON format.
